After much work and trial and error on my V2 portfolio (the one that looks like a desktop), I have decided to start from scratch on a more modern design. I will be revisiting the old one for a different site.

Features

- Background is all one gradient extended. Starts dark green, gets brighter on the second page then darker on the 3rd and 4th. Kind of like falling from the a greenish sky.
- Color is inspired by Thomas Brushe's color work in his backgrounds for video games.

About Page

- Needs to have a carousel for each section. The old portfolio was a long string of sections
- Keep it simple and natural to use. Not a lot of text. Let images and flow tell the story
- Focus on using re-usable classes

1. Introduction
2. Technology I know & am learning
3. Timeline of my process (Icons with a short heading)

Projects Page

- When hovering over project icons (screenshots) the gradient needs to cover the image (but transparent)
- Clicking on a project should bring up a pop-up that tells a summary, the tech stack used, and a button to go to the project site. Should be able to switch between projects from the popup as well.

1. The Portfolio
2. Gamers Make Games
3. 100 Days To Code - Word Press
4. Family Reunion Site
5. Music Player
6. Something using 3 JS
7. A Shopify App
