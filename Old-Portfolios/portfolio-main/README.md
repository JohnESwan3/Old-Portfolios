Goals:
A) Create a portfolio site using SASS, VUE.js, Rellax.js and Bootstrap
B) Learn Vue.JS and apply what I have learned in new ways
C) Show what I have learned
D) !!Documentation on Everything!!

1. Mac / iOS inspired UI - Glass/Ice theme
2. All one webpage
   a) Use CSS animations and JS to transition to different pages
   b) Pages have a transparent and blurred background
   c) Upon loading page, text fades out so the only background is the background image.
   d) Top bar with name and a music player that is persistant (maybe no music player)
3. Links are icons on top of buttons
   a) Icons should glow when clicked and stop glowing when unchecked.
4. Have particles (maybe particle.js) appear when a page is loaded.
   a) Different type of particles with each page.
   b) Particles should appear behind the page so it looks like it is behind glass or under ice.
5. Theme is ice/snow.
6. Rellax.js?

NOTES

7/27/2021

- Changed from Ubuntu theme to MacOS. App bar is on the bottom. This brings consistency to desktop and mobile and mobile looks like a mobile UI
- I am debating whether or not to add particles with Particle.JS to the home page to make it look interesting. I worry that it will be too much flair.
- I am not sure if I like the JS logo glowing (without animation). I am also considering changing the logo to a different text style. The page headings also need to have a different text style but I like the cohesion of having the headings look the same as the JS logo.
- I am starting to learn React today and may decide to convert the entire portfolio to React. Because of this, progress will slow down, but I would like to finish it so I can at least have a completed portfolio.
- I am not sure if I want to keep the glass theme for each individual page. I feel great about a glassmorphic contact page, but I am unsure about the Projects and About pages. I need to do more research on different projects that use this style.
- A few weeks ago I got stuck on the JS part of this project. Now I found it to be easy to get the buttons working and loading pages. I am making progress even though it doesn't feel like it.
- I need to get better at using Git and GitHub

-GPU usage is high - likely because of transparency and blur. Performs fine on all of my devices but I need to test on a lower end machine. Battery life on my laptop is an hour or two now so this needs to be improved.
